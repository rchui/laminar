### Easy to Write

`laminar` brings together many of the best ideas from the various workflow frameworks that came before it. The specifications are declarative, and concepts are consistent throughout the framework.

### Container First

Containers are first class citizens in `laminar` flows. Containers are both used as a "write once, deploy anywhere" method of packaging software applications for portability, and for comparmentalization and isolation of `laminar` flow layers from each other.

### Total Control

Flows in `laminar` are highly configurable, both statically at definition time, and dynamically at run time.

### Any Scale

`laminar` flows can scale to any size of compute compute. From small locally run prototypes to tens of thousands of concurrent executions running in the cloud, `laminar` can handle it all.
