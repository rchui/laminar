Laminar
=======

*slow is smooth, and smooth is fast*

Easy to Write
-------------

``laminar`` brings together many of the best ideas from the various workflow frameworks that came before it. The specifications are declarative, and concepts are consistent throughout the framework.

Container First
---------------

Containers are first class citizens in ``laminar`` flows. Containers are both used as a "write once, deploy anywhere" method of packaging software applications for portability, and for comparmentalization and isolation of ``laminar`` flow layers from each other.

Total Control
-------------

Flows in ``laminar`` are highly configurable, both statically at definition time, and dynamically at run time.

Any Scale
---------

``laminar`` flows can scale to any size of compute. From small locally run prototypes to tens of thousands of concurrent executions running in the cloud, ``laminar`` can handle it all.
